# Disjoint set data strutcture and their union
Python implemetation of Union of disjoint set data structures.  
I was dissatisfied with other python implementations of [Disjoint sets data-structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure), so I implemented this class based on [Competitive Programming](https://cpbook.net/) book by Steven Halim and Felix Halim.   
### Testing
For testing I used a rather pecuilar approach, I used the `test.py` for solving a [codeforces.com](https://codeforces.com/contest/1167/problem/C) problem which tests it extensively.
